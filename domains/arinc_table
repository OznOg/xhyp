#	each size must be large enough to hold minor slices
#	minor
#	each minor frame has a slot start and a size
#	and an associated domain.
#	The associated domain gets to run inside the slice
# id	not used by xhyp, only here to facilitate the configuration
#	frames are taken in order.
# start offset from start of period in ticks
# size	duration of the slice in ticks
